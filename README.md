House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict house prices using the Boston Housing dataset. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), and building a regression model using Scikit-learn's Linear Regression.

Technologies Used
Python üêç

Pandas & NumPy

Seaborn & Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

 Key Steps
Data Loading
Load the Boston Housing dataset using Scikit-learn.

Data Cleaning

Handle missing values

Remove duplicates (if any)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation matrix

Visual inspection of feature relationships

Feature Selection with RFE

Use Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Linear Regression to select top 6 features.

Model Building

Train a Linear Regression model

Evaluate performance with MSE and R¬≤

Prediction & Visualization

Compare actual vs predicted prices using scatter plot.

Clone the repo:

Create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebook:

jupyter notebook

Results
R¬≤ Score: ~0.73

Top 6 Features (via RFE): Example ‚Äì RM, LSTAT, PTRATIO, etc.
